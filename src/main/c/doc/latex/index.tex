S\-L\-I\-M Curve is an exponential curve fitting library used for Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging or F\-L\-I\-M and Spectral Lifetime Imaging or S\-L\-I\-M. It is based on code developed by Paul Barber and his group at the Gray Institute for Radiation Oncology \& Biology and used for F\-L\-I\-M functionality in his T\-R\-I2 (Time Resolved Imaging) software. It is also used in the L\-O\-C\-I S\-L\-I\-M Plugin project.

There are two algorithms used for curve fitting within S\-L\-I\-M Curve\-: The first is a triple integral method that does a very fast estimate of a single exponential lifetime component. The second is a Levenberg-\/\-Marquardt algorithm or L\-M\-A that uses an iterative, least-\/squares-\/minimization approach to generate a fit. This works with single, double and triple exponential models, as well as stretched exponential.

The code is written in C89 compatible C and is thread safe for fitting multiple pixels concurrently. Several files are provided as wrappers to call this library from Java code\-: Ecf\-Wrapper.\-c and .h provide a subset of function calls used by S\-L\-I\-M Plugin, these may be invoked directly from Java using J\-N\-A. In addition there is a Java Curve\-Fitter project that provides a wrapper to the S\-L\-I\-M Curve code. This invokes the C code using J\-N\-I, with loci\-\_\-curvefitter\-\_\-\-S\-L\-I\-M\-Curve\-Fitter.\-c and .h.
